Kids ChorePad

Application Overview:
I plan to build an application to encourage children to do the tasks by their own without the adult supervision.This App helps parents/adults to track their kids progress in their Academic,and helps to manage their kids time in a very productive way. The primary user of this App is children,and the secondary users will be Adults/parents. This App helps kids to manage,regularize their work by themself. It also motivates the kids to complete their daily tasks and get full rewards/stickers for that day,which can be noticed by parents as well. It minimises the work for parents towards their kids activities.
I built this application in two weeks initially, using React Hooks and CSS for styling. 
My goals were to incorporate full CRUD functionality with many-to-many relationships, gain a deeper understanding of React Hooks, props, and state, while also incorporating an intuitive, functional user interface, without the use of bootstrapped components.

Features:
Parent Users can register an email and a password.
The Parent User can login in to the app.
Parents can register their kids.
Parents can create chores for their Kids.
Kids users can log into app(Kids dashboard).
AfterKids users logging in, they can see the Main page with their    
	Chores or classes  or events

Runnng this Application:
First, a note about authentication...

This application uses mock authentication which is purely for demonstration purposes. Therefore the login and registration code written here is completely insecure and would never be implemented in a professional application.

Now that we've cleared that up...

Clone this repository and change to the directory in the terminal.
